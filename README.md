# FCC-Survey Form-for personal test

This is a simple survey form I built while learning HTML and CSS through FreeCodeCamp.

The form includes basic form elements like text inputs, dropdown, radio buttons, checkboxes, and a submit button. It's a simple project to practice my front-end development skills.

Feel free to check out the code and let me know if you have any feedback!
